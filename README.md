# Weather Watch

Weather forecast for the day with comments based off the current forecast. It utilizes the Open Weather Map API to generate the forecast for the next 12 hours from the zip code inputted. The temperature is displayed in both fahrenheit and celsius and displays different weather icons and displays a different background for different types of weather. My first project with React.
